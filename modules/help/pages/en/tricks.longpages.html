If you are ready to complain that pages you receive are too long to browse, we have two news for you:

<ol>  
  <li>We are working hard to prevent this from happening.</li>
  <li>If this happens, this not a problem at all!</li>
</ol>

<p>First news may seem not so obvious, as it's everyone's personal impression 
of how well and how quickly IT department addresses complains from the user.</p>

<p>However, the second item in the list above always come to help.
You might be surprised, but computers were designed in first place to make our lives
easier, not more difficult. As a consequence, there are plenty cool things that boost
our productivity but we don't know about them.</p>

<p>Now, ask yourself, what do you do when expected information does not fit to the screen,
and page seems to be longer than the visible area of your screen?</p>

<p>If your answer sounds like 'I need to click on the small button on a narrow ribbon 
in the right side of the page and pull it down while holding a left mouse button', 
then we'll sigh and empatically shake our heads.</p>

<p>This is basically a correct answer, but it's just one way to scroll the page.
The most awkward and time consuming way, which also suggests a good skill of manipulating mouse.</p>

<p>The more convenient truth is that you do not need to touch your mouth at all! 
Look at your keyboard, and you well see magic keys named PgUp and PgDwn.
They do the wonderful trick of scrolling respectively one page up or down.</p>

<p>Even more magical are two keys named 'Home' and 'End'. They scroll all page at once,
presenting you to the beginning of the page, or to its very bottom, respectively.</p>

<p>Now, you need not to precisely operate a mouse when you need to go back 
to the top of the page, where there are menus and useful links. Just use the keyboard!</p>

<p>And remember, this works not only in Tickets, but on every single web page!</p>
